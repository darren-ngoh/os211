# Top 10 List of Week 03

### 1. [The Linux Filesystem Explained](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/)
A filesystem or fs controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. Let's learn more about filesystem especially Linux on this article made by Linux itself!

### 2. [Understanding Linux filesystem](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/ext4-filesystem)
The majority of modern Linux distributions default to the ext4 filesystem, just as previous Linux distributions defaulted to ext3, ext2, and – if you go back far enough – ext. This article cover almost everything on filesystems and a very good pre-knowledge for us before continuing to our next learnings.

### 3. [Partitions and filesystem in Linux](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/tutorials/l-lpic1-104-1/)
Back when we were installing Debian on our VirtualBox, we do a lot of partitioning disk spaces. What are those? We can learn how to do the right partitioning on this article by IBM!

### 4. [Mount and Unmount File System in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-mount-and-unmount-file-systems-in-linux/)
On Linux and UNIX operating systems, you can use the mount command to attach (mount) file systems and removable devices such as USB flash drives at a particular mount point in the directory tree. The unmount command detaches (unmounts) the mounted file system from the directory tree. In this tutorial, we will go over the basics of attaching and detaching various file systems using the mount and unmount commands.

### 5. [Linux Virtual File System](https://likegeeks.com/linux-virtual-file-system)
The Linux virtual file system or virtual file system generally is a layer that sits on the top of your actual file system. It allows the user to access different types of file systems, you can think of the virtual file system as an interface between the kernel and the actual file system. This article tells us more about Linux Virtual File System!

### 6. [File System Implementation](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/12_FileSystemImplementation.html)
This article covers everything we need to know about File System Implementation. From Partitions and Mounting, Virtual File System, Directory Implementation, Allocation Methods, and many more!

### 7. [Free Space Management in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/free-space-management-in-operating-system/)
The system keeps tracks of the free disk blocks for allocating space to files when they are created. Also, to reuse the space released from deleting the files, free space management becomes crucial. The system maintains a free space list which keeps track of the disk blocks that are not allocated to some file or directory. This GeeksforGeeks article covers what free space list can be implemented as.

### 8. [Efficiency and Performance of File System](https://youtu.be/djlF1f6frMA)
The efficient use of disk space depends heavily on the disk allocation and directory algorithms in use. This YouTube video briefly explains the efficiency and perfomance of File System in Operating System.

### 9. [Unified Buffer Cache](http://www.mallorn.com/People/lindsey/test/c0504.htm)
To increase file system performance, Digital implemented a Unified Buffer Cache (UBC) fully integrated with the file system that caches file system data and can grow or shrink upon demand. This short article gives quick explanation on what is UBC and what is the usage of UBC.

### 10. [Log-Structured File System (LFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/log-structured-file-system-lfs/)
A log-structured filesystem is a file system in which data and metadata are written sequentially to a circular buffer, called a log. This article made by GeeksforGeeks tells everything we need to know on Log-Structurd File System!
