# Top 10 List of Week 08

### 1. [Difference Between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling in OS](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling-in-os.html)
The basic difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling is that in preemptive scheduling the CPU is allocated to the processes for the limited time. While in Non-preemptive scheduling, the CPU is allocated to the process till it terminates or switches to waiting state.

### 2. [More on Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)
Following the last number, GeekforGeeks also made a conncise article about scheduling! Let's take a quick read!

### 3. [Scheduling Policies for Operating System](https://study.com/academy/lesson/scheduling-policies-for-operating-systems-importance-criteria.html)
There are several criteria for invoking the best scheduling policies for a system. This site tells us about those policies.

### 4. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)
CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.

### 5. [Processes and Threads](https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/os/processes-and-threads.html)
A process is an instance of program execution. This means, for example, that if you open up two browser windows then you have two processes, even though they are running the same program. Let's take a look!

### 6. [Difference between Process and Threads](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)
As usual, GeekforGeeks makes an awesome article about Process and Threads. Let's take a look!

### 7. [Threads and its types in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/threads-and-its-types-in-operating-system/)
Thread is a single sequence stream within a process. Threads have same properties as of the process so they are called as light weight processes. Threads are executed one after another but gives the illusion as if they are executing in parallel.

### 8. [Convoy Effect in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convoy-effect-operating-systems/)
Convoy Effect is phenomenon associated with the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm, in which the whole Operating System slows down due to few slow processes. Let's have a look.

### 9. [Deadline Scheduling for Real-Time Systems](https://study.com/academy/lesson/deadline-scheduling-for-real-time-systems.html)
Real-time systems are all around us. They are in our home appliances, banking ATM's, cash registers, and even in trains, planes, and automobiles. Real-time systems outnumber all other types of computers. This lesson provides a detailed look at how real-time systems schedule the tasks that control our world.

### 10. [Scheduling Issues in Real-Time](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/741)
There are a lot of issues in scheduling in real-time. Let's take a quick read.
