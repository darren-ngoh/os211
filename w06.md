# Top 10 List of Week 06

### 1. [States of a Process in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/states-of-a-process-in-operating-systems)
The process, from its creation to completion, passes through various states. The minimum number of states is five. The names of the states are not stadardized although the process may be in one of the following stages during execution.

### 2. [Process States](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)
Following the last article, javapoint also made an awesome article explaining every process states. Let’s skim through it to get extra grasp on process states!

### 3. [Threads, Processes, and Dispatching](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring14/lecture.php?topic=thread)
Stanford made a good article about Threads and Processes. Let’s take a quick read!

### 4. [Context Switching & Dispatcher](https://youtu.be/YIMsIijWjQo)
This lecture discuses about concepts of process management which covers all detailed concepts of the process management, process attributes, process operations, process state diagram, context switching, and more. Let’s learn all these concepts in detail by watching this short video!

### 5. [Interrupt in Process State Diagram](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52341178/what-is-interrupt-for-transition-of-a-process-from-running-to-ready)
There are two ways for a process to transition from the running state to the ready state. If we use preemptive multitasking, the OS uses timer interrupt to regularly interrupt whatever process is currently running.

### 6. [Spinlocks in multiprocesser](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/why-spinlocks-are-not-appropriate-for-single-processor-systems-yet-are-often-used-in-multiprocessor-systems)
This geekforgeeks answers all your questions regarding spinlocks. Lets take a look.

### 7. [Reentrant Function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reentrant-function/)
A function is said to be reentrant if there is a provision to interrupt the function in the course of execution, service the interrupt service routine and then resume the earlier going on function, without hampering its earlier course of action. Reentrant functions are used in applications like hardware interrupt handling, recursion, etc.

### 8. [Single Thread Vs. Multi Thread Perfomance](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/single-thread-versus-multi-thread-performance.2384193)
Both single thread and multi thread have their own pros and cons. Let’s read this informative forum to learn about them.

### 9. [Multi-Threading Models](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/multi-threading-models)
Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These parts are known as threads and are lightweight processes available within the process. Therefore, multithread leads to maximum utilization of the CPU by multitasking.

### 10. [PThread Programming Tutorial](https://medium.com/adamedelwiess/operating-system-8-a-tutorial-for-the-pthread-programming-bf8004e36e70)
Birrel’s paper talked about threads :in a general way. However, PThreads is a very concrete multithreading system and it is the default standard in the UNIX system. PThreads stands for POSIX threads, and POSIX means Portable Operating System Interface, which is a kind of interface that the operating system needs to support. Within POSIX, PThreads describes the threading APIs the operating system needs to support.
