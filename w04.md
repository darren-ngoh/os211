### 1. [Bit, Byte, and Word](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~pearce/modules/lectures/co/ds/bits.htm)
Before proceeding to Adressing, Shared Lib, & Pointer, we should know the basics, <strong><i>Bit, Byte, and Word</i></strong>. This short webpage explains simply the correlation between those 3 things.

### 2. [Hardware Protection and Type of Hardware Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)
In this article, we are going to learn about hardware protection and its type. There are mainly three kind of <strong><i>Hardware Protection</i></strong>: CPU Protection, Memory Protection, and I/O Protection.

### 3. [What is hardware protection?](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/hardware-protection.aspx)
This article helps explain more about the topic in the previous number. We can learn more by reading more!

### 4. [What is the difference between linking and binding?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26193559/what-is-the-difference-between-linking-and-binding)
Linking and Binding are two very similar functions. This simple answer to a stackoverflow question answers it all!

### 5. [Memory Allocation](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27492/memory-allocation)
<strong><i>Memory Allocation</i></strong> is a process by which computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space. Memory allocation has two core types: Static Memory Allocation and Dynamic Memory Allocation.

### 6. [Memory Management in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)
Memory management in the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. This tutorial will teach you basic concepts related to <strong><i>Memory Management</i></strong>.

### 7. [What is fragmentation and what are its types?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-fragmentation-and-what-are-its-types)
In contiguous memory allocation whenever the procceses come into RAM, space is allocated to them. These spaces in RAM are divided either on the basis of fixed partitioning or dynamic partitioning. As the process gets loaded and removed from the memory these spaces get broken into small pieces of memory that it can't be allocated to the coming processes. This problem is called <strong>fragmentation</strong>.

### 8. [Difference between Internal and External fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-internal-and-external-fragmentation/)
There are two types of <strong>fragmentation</strong> in OS which are given as: Internal fragmentation, and External fragmentation. GeekforGeeks sums up pretty clear and simple for us!

### 9. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system)
Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as <strong><i>Virtual Address</i></strong>. The hardware device called Memory-Management Unit is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding <strong><i>physical address</i></strong>.

### 10. [Linux Libraries Basic](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html)
Libraries in Linux are categorized into two main libraries, <strong><i>Static</i></strong> and <strong><i>Shared</i></strong>. This article gives out explanations and tutorials simply!
