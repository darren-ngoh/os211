# Top 10 List of Week 07

### 1. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)
This short tutorial covered the concept of **Process Synchronization** in an operating system. Process Synchronization was introduced to handle problems that arose while multiple process executions.

### 2. [Introduction to Deadlocks in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlocks)
Deadlocks are a set of blocked processes each holding a resource and waiting to acquire a resource held by another process. Let's read more about deadlocks on this well-written article!

### 3. [Deadlock Prevention in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlock-prevention-in-operating-system)
This tutorial elaborates the deadlock prevention approach. Let's take a quick look.

### 4. [Deadlock Avoidance in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlock-avoidance-in-operating-system)
This tutorial covers deadlock avoidance in the operating system. The deadlock avoidance method is used by the operating system in order to check whether the system is in a safe state or in a unsafe state and in order to avoid the deadlocks.

### 5. [Classical Probelms of Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/classical-problems-of-synchronization)
We will find out about the various classical problems of process synchronization on this awesomely curated article. Semaphore can be used in other synchronization problems besides Mutual Exclusion.

### 6. [Peterson's Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)
Peterson's Algorithm is used to synchronize two processes. It uses two variable, a bool array flag of size 2 and an int variable turn to accomplish it.

### 7. [Critical Selection in Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-70/)
When more than one processes access a same code segment that segment is known as **critical section**. Critical section contains shared variables or resources which are needed to be synchronized to maintain consistency of data variable.

### 8. [Dekker's Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dekkers-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)
To obtain such a mutual exclusion, bounded waiting, and progress there have been several algorithms implemented, one of which is **Dekker's Algorithm**. This algorithm has connection to Peterson's Solution mentioned above. Let's learn about Dekker's!

### 9. [Bakery Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bakery-algorithm-in-process-synchronization)
The **Bakery Algorithm** is one of simplest knwon solutions to the mutual exclusion problem for the general case of N process. Bakery Algorithm is a critical solution for N processes. The algorithm preserves the first come first serve property.

### 10. [Inter Process Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)
**Inter-process communication (IPC)** is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. The communication between these processes can be seen as a method of co-operation between them.
